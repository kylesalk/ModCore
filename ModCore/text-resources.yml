RemindersGuide: |
  The time span parser is fluent and will understand many different formats of time, as long as they follow the base:
  
  [in] <Time span> [to] [Message]
  
  Where "Time span" represents a time period such as
  \* Tomorrow
  \* Next fortnight
  \* 8 hours 20 minutes
  \* 2h
  \* 4m5s
  \* 15min
  \* 30min55sec
  
  See these examples:
  
  ```
  +remindme next week to walk the dog
  +remindme tomorrow fix socket
  +remindme 2h5m watch new stranger things episode
  +remindme 8 hours wake up
  +remindme in an hour to eat something
  +remindme in nine months to have a baby
  +remindme in 7 minutes
  +remindme 7m
  ```
  
  Note that even if your arguments don't fit the grammar denoted above, they might still be parsed fine.
  If in doubt, just try it! You can always clear the reminders later. 

DefconGuide: |
  Controls for automated anti-raiding mechanisms.
  During DEFCON mode, some settings are temporarily changed to protect your server.
  All actions taken by the anti-raid will be logged to a new channel, normally called `#defcon`.
  DEFCON tries to be as non-destructive as possible, but some actions could lead to false positives.
  Please read the information provided for the DEFCON level you're looking at before blindly selecting it.
